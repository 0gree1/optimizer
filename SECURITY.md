## Best Practice

it's always recommended to use the latest version of the Optimizer.
You can always download the new version by the official GitHub of the project
or inside the app.

The app will always check for new versions upon each run and an icon will be
visible in case of an available update.

You can review the upcoming changes before you update it.

Also, ensure that your Optimizer is the original using the latest SHA256 hash
in the main page of this GitHub.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can always report a vulnerability or a security concern by opening
an issue and providing all the required details.

All security-related issues will be accepted in the first 24 hours
and an update will be provided as soon as possible (usually 7-10 days).
